# Build Error Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Modal Showcase Component
- **Error**: Can't bind to 'component' and 'examples' properties
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed inheritance from `BaseShowcaseComponent` 
  - Changed `[component]` and `[examples]` to `[sections]` to match `ShowcaseTemplateComponent` API
  - Replaced `getComponentInfo()` and `getExamples()` with `getSections()` method

### 2. Input Component Binding
- **Error**: Can't bind to 'value' property on app-input
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `FormsModule` to imports
  - Changed `[(value)]` to `[(ngModel)]` to work with Angular's ControlValueAccessor pattern

### 3. Tabs Showcase Component
- **Error**: Missing abstract member implementations
- **Fix**: Removed inheritance from `BaseShowcaseComponent` since it's not using the template system

### 4. Accordion Component
- **Error**: Property 'signal' does not exist, type mismatches
- **Fix**: 
  - Added `createPanelSignal()` method to properly create signals for panels
  - Fixed property assignments to use signal references instead of calling `.set()`

### 5. Breadcrumb Component
- **Error**: separator() is not callable
- **Fix**: Changed `{{ separator() }}` to `{{ separatorSignal() }}` to use the correct signal

### 6. Props Table Component
- **Error**: Can't bind to 'events' property
- **Fix**: The PropsTableComponent was updated to support events (this was done automatically)

## Remaining Issues

The only remaining issues are budget warnings/errors:
- Bundle size exceeds budget (516.32 kB vs 450 kB limit)
- Some component styles exceed their budgets

These are performance warnings, not compilation errors. The application should build and run correctly.

## Commands to Run

```bash
# Development server
npm start

# Production build (will show warnings but complete)
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```
