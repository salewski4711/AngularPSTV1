# TimePickerComponent onTouched() Method Fix

## Issue
The template was trying to access a private `onTouched()` method, which violates Angular's template type checking and TypeScript's access modifiers.

## Solution
Following SOLID principles (specifically the Open/Closed Principle), we:

1. **Kept the internal callback private**: The `onTouched` callback remains private as it's part of the internal ControlValueAccessor implementation.

2. **Created a public wrapper method**: Added `markAsTouched()` as a public method that the template can safely call.

3. **Fixed template binding**: Updated the template from `(focus)="onTouched()"` to `(focus)="markAsTouched()"`.

4. **Fixed computed property issue**: Changed `amPmClasses` from a computed signal to a regular method `getAmPmClasses()` to fix template compilation errors.

## Code Changes

### Component Class (time-picker.component.ts)
```typescript
// Added public method for template access
markAsTouched(): void {
  this.onTouched();
}

// Changed from computed signal to regular method
getAmPmClasses(period: 'AM' | 'PM'): string {
  const isActive = this.amPm() === period;
  if (isActive) {
    return 'bg-primary-500 text-white hover:bg-primary-600';
  }
  return 'bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-700 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-200 dark:hover:bg-gray-600';
}
```

### Template Updates
```html
<!-- Changed from onTouched() to markAsTouched() -->
(focus)="markAsTouched()"

<!-- Changed from amPmClasses('AM') to getAmPmClasses('AM') -->
[class]="getAmPmClasses('AM')"
[class]="getAmPmClasses('PM')"
```

## Benefits
- Maintains proper encapsulation
- Follows Angular best practices
- Resolves template compilation errors
- Keeps internal implementation details private
- Provides clear public API for template interaction
