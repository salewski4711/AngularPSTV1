# Solution Summary: Angular Build Errors

## Root Cause Analysis

The "Component imports must be standalone components" errors are NOT because the components aren't marked as standalone. They ARE marked with `standalone: true`.

The real issue is a **compilation cascade failure**:

1. Components use template string interpolations with `${TokenUtils...}` in their templates
2. Angular's AOT compiler cannot statically analyze these dynamic strings
3. This prevents the component from being fully compiled
4. Which makes them appear as "not standalone" to other components importing them

## The Wrong Approach (What We Tried)

- Manually fixing template strings one by one ❌
- Using a script to convert template strings to computed properties ❌
- This created more problems and took too much time

## The Right Approach

### 1. Use Existing Infrastructure
- The codebase already has `formClasses` in `tailwind.utils.ts` 
- These are pre-compiled, static class strings
- They follow the design system correctly

### 2. Key Principles
- **NEVER use TokenUtils in templates** - Angular needs static strings
- **Use computed properties** for dynamic classes
- **Use formClasses** for form components
- **Keep templates simple** - complexity belongs in TypeScript

### 3. Example Migration

**Wrong:**
```typescript
template: `<div class="${TokenUtils.getColorClass('bg', 'primary')}">`
```

**Right:**
```typescript
template: `<div [class]="containerClasses">`,
// In component:
containerClasses = computed(() => {
  return this.disabled ? 'bg-gray-100' : 'bg-primary';
});
```

## Next Steps

1. Use the existing `formClasses` from `tailwind.utils.ts`
2. For non-form components, create similar static class maps
3. Use computed properties for dynamic class switching
4. Keep all TokenUtils usage in TypeScript, never in templates

This approach is:
- ✅ Faster (no manual string replacements)
- ✅ Cleaner (uses existing patterns)
- ✅ Maintainable (follows Angular best practices)
- ✅ Scalable (can be applied to all components systematically)
